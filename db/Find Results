   54: ## Get started with Webpacker
   55  
   56  [or Get started with Sprockets](#use-with-asset-pipeline)
   57  
   58: [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) integrates modern JS tooling with Rails.
   59  
   60: Add `webpacker` and `react-rails` to your gemfile and run the installers:
   61  
   62  ```
   63  $ bundle install
   64: $ rails webpacker:install
   65: $ rails webpacker:install:react
   66  $ rails generate react:install
   67  ```
   ..
  294  
  295  - On the asset pipeline, it looks up `className` in the global namespace.
  296: - On Webpacker, it `require`s files and accesses named exports, as described in [Use with Webpacker](#use-with-webpacker).
  297  
  298  You can override this function to customize the mapping of name-to-constructor. [Server-side rendering](#server-side-rendering) also uses this function.
  ...
  524  For the vast majority of cases this will get you most of the migration:
  525  - global find+replace `React.Prop` -> `Prop`
  526: - add `import PropTypes from 'prop-types'` (Webpacker only)
  527: - re-run `bundle exec rails webpacker:install:react` to update npm packages (Webpacker only)
